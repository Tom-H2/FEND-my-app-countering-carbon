# Countering Carbon Neighborhood React App

### Overview and Acknowledgements
The Countering Carbon App represents the final project for the Udacity Grow With Google Front End Nano Degree. The requirements and rubric can be found [here](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1351/view)

It is mostly the work of Thomas Harris, as partial fullfillment of the FEND requirements. This app could not have been completed without the help and support of countless people and countless resources. A more complete list can be found in the Colaborations section below but I wanted to acknowledge here the help of Susan Pommer who has been my Study Buddy over the past months and who has been invaluable in helping complete this project.


### Instructions to open and use App
The project repo can be accessed at [GitHub](https://github.com/Tom-H2/FEND-my-app-countering-carbon.git)

Go to https://github.com/Tom-H2/FEND-my-app-countering-carbon repo in Github
Clone/download repo and select download
That action puts a copy of your repo in the computer's download folder
Move that zipped folder from download to a C:// folder and unzipped (extract all)
In a terminal window navigate to the file location of unzipped folder
Entered "npm install react"
After that is complete, entered "npm start"
New browser window opens program running

###Purpose and Use of the App
This one page app was written using React, React libraries, Google Maps, and FourSquareAPI. The code centers the map on down town Port Angles, WA and the markers represent bars in town. This query, and the radius of the initial API call are hardcoded in the App.js file on lines 118 to 121.

To find information about any of the venues marked on the map click the marker and that will open an infowindow. This can also be done via the sid bar. Click on the hamburger button to view a list of the venues. By clicking the venue name the infowindow will appear. Also the sidebar has an input box that allows for filtering the venues.
